        I implemented basic functionality for user-created chats. Chat needs to
        be created with initial name and participants. Users can add other users
        and can leave chats, but cannot join chats on their own. I choose those
        to match common direct messaging apps, as my design is around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, leaving the app is not fully implemented, and there might be
        errors with proper access control. Also UI needs some improvements.
